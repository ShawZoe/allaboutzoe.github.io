        <div class="in1-2">
            <p>
                One of my strongest traits is my openness to experience. This trait has helped me to adapt and strive in new environments, particularly, the various schools I 
                ended up attending. Transferring schools never disrupted my academic and social development. My openness to experience is also what led me to the Math Olympiad 
                in Grade 7. It wasn't something I had ever done before but doing it was a great experience for me and I ended up participating every available year after. In 
                regard to academics, I have no problem with learning new subjects, topics or methods of solving questions and this can be attributed to one o my strongest traits, 
                openness to experience.

        <div class="in2-2">
            <p>
                My strongest emotion is indifference. This emotion has not particularly had a negative effect on my school life. In fact, it has helped me in surviving group work, 
                transferring schools and not allowing anxiety to consume me about tests, exams and grades so that I am able to do what is needed of me. My indiffence has allowed 
                work towards my goals and meet deadlines with peace and contentment.

        <div class="in3-1"><h3 class="subhead">Art</h3></div>
        <div class="in3-2">
            <p>
                One of my most favoured hobbies, is doing anything art related. This ranges from drawing, painting and colouring to fabric dyeing, carving, sewing amongst many others.
                Art is something that I've always enjoyed doing and I often find myself drawing in the margins of my school notebooks. This hobby also directly affected my academic life
                when I chose to do Visual Arts as one of my CSEC subjects. I chose Visual Arts not only because I wanted to include a skill in my list of subjects but also because I genuinely
                enjoyed it. It is also a highly useful hobby to have as it has often saved me when having to do projects for school.

            <h3>Who is Zuko?</h3>
            <p>
                From the Nickelodeon animated television series "Avatar the Last Airbender," Zuko is a Fire Nation Royal and expert firebender. He is the sole son and the
                oldest child of Fire Lord Ozai and Princess Ursa. Zuko, who was once the main foe of Team Avatar, spent three years attempting to find the long-lost Avatar
                in order to end his exile and reclaim his position as Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. He was given a distinctive burn scar on the left side of his face by
                his father when he was thirteen, not long before he was banished as punishment for an incident in which he unintentionally disrespected his father by
                speaking out of turn and declining to duel him. This scar makes him easily identifiable. After much internal conflict and strife, Zuko became disillusioned
                and rejected Ozai and his idea of the Fire Nation, with the help of his paternal uncle, Gneral Iroh. Instead, he joined the Avatar's crew, where he became
                Aang's longtime friend and firebending mentor. He was driven to put an end to the conflict and reclaim both his and the Fire Nation's honor. He assumed the
                role of Fire Lord with the defeat of Ozai and his sister, Azula, and announced the end of the Hundred Year War and the beginning of a brand-new period of
                love and peace.

        <div class="in4-5">
            <h3>Why did I chose Zuko?</h3>
            <p>
                Zuko is a determined person that will try a million times over just for the slim chance that he might succeed. That sort of determination is something that 
                I admire and hope to reflect within myself. I can also relate to his awkward nature and inability to properly express himself and communicate with others. But 
                as in other areas of his life, he doesn't stop trying. Zuko managed to go from a dislikeable character to my all-time favourite because he was able to recognize
                his mistakes, acknowledge his faults and actively worked to correct and make up for them. At the end of the day, he was never a bad person, just a boy desperate
                for his father's approval. I chose Zuko as my hero because he is proof that people are capable of change, you should fight for what you believe in and that despite 
                failure, you should never stop trying.
