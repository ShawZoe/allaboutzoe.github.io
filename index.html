                <p>
                    Born into a family of four, she is an older sister at the age of twenty. Her poor memory denies her the privilage of being able to
                    recall her most formative years. Despite this, she can proudly say she has lived a life full of learning experiences. She was born in
                    the University Hospital, St. Andrew, but spent most of her life living in St. Mary while attending school in St. Ann. She spent two
                    years at an early childhood instituion, where she best recalls having her father balding her hair. After this, she moved to her first
                    prep school, Iona, where she spent three years and experienced a major injury. She made two friends there, one of which transferred at the
                    same time to the same prep school, United Learning Centre, where she spent the rest of her prep school life. She did well on the GSAT exam
                    and got into St. Hilda's Diocesan High School, her first choice. While there she participated in the Math Olympiad, earning 9th place in
                    grade 7. After spending three years there, she left her friends and immediate family to go to Kingston and attend Immaculate Conception
                    High School. Which is where she graduated from and attended Sixth Form.
